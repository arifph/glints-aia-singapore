# glints-aia-singapore
My source code for the test in AIA Singapore (applied via Glints)

Notes:
1. I use openjdk Java 11 to compile the code
2. I run it in Eclipse. The application will run in the console.
3. The application can also be run via terminal or command prompt. I had already add a Main.class file in the same package.
